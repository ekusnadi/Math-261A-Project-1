## Author & Submission Info
- **Author:** Ethan Kusnadi  
- **Date of Submission:** September 24, 2025  

## Project Structure
- **Report:** `Math 261A Paper 1 - Version 1.pdf`  
  First draft of the project report.  
- **Code:** `project_1.R`  
  R script for data cleaning, regression modeling, and visualization.

  Raw dataset from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA).  

## External Resources
This project used **ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, 2025)** as an external resource. ChatGPT was used for:  
- Feedback on the clarity and flow of writing  
- Suggestions for formatting R code and visualizations  
- Help in locating and summarizing information from assigned course sources and documentation (e.g., CalEnviroScreen documentation)  
- Assistance in writing this README file  
- Converting the paper into Quarto format  

All base code, data analysis, and interpretation of results were performed independently by me.  

*Note: Chat logs could not be shared due to SJSU turning off the share feature in the ChatGPT Enterprise.*
