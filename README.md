## External Resources
This project used **ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, 2025)** as an external resource. ChatGPT was used for:  
- Feedback and assistance in revising the clarity, organization, and flow of writing
- Suggestions for formatting R code and visualizations
- Guidance on meeting project guidelines and rubric requirements
- Help locating and summarizing information from assigned course sources and documentation (e.g., CalEnviroScreen documentation)
- Assistance compiling the reference list and drafting this README file
- Converting the report into Quarto format  

All base code, data analysis, and interpretation of results were performed independently by me.  

*Note: Chat logs could not be shared due to SJSU turning off the share feature in the ChatGPT Enterprise.*
