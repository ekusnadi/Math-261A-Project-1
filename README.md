This project used ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, 2025) as an external resource. ChatGPT was used for:
- Feedback on the clarity and flow of my writing
- Suggestions for formatting R code and visualizations
- Help in locating and summarizing information from assigned course sources (e.g., CalEnviroScreen documentation)
All data analysis, coding, and interpretation of results were performed independently by me.
